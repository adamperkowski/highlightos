# HighlightOS
x86_64 OS (kernel) made completely from scratch in Assembly & Rust

This documentation includes only the "main kernel" (inside the `/kernel` directory).

Documentation for bleeding-edge main can be found at [https://os.adamperkowski.dev/main](https://os.adamperkowski.dev/main).

Keep in mind that this website is still a WIP.
